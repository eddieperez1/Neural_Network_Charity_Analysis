# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis



## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.



## Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions.

### Data Preprocessing

- IS_SUCCESSFUL is considered the target for the model
- APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, STATUS, INCOME_AMT, SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS, and ASK_AMT are considered to be the features for the model
- EIN	and NAME are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

- How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
- Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
- What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?

## Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
